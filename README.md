## It runs

`warp` is written in twill, in `.tw` files, using `mode systems`. That subset
did not exist when this library was written, so for a long time none of the code
here executed and this section said so. twill 1.6 is the release that closed it:
the 5 test suites under `tests/` pass, and CI runs them against a released
twill on every push rather than gating on the prose in this file.

`docs/needs.md` is the list of what this library asked the language for, and
it records which of those arrived and which are still open.

## Getting started

warp needs twill 1.7.0 or newer. There is nothing to build: warp is twill
source and twill runs it.

```bash
curl -fsSL -o twill \
  https://github.com/twill-lang/twill/releases/download/v1.7.1/twill-v1.7.1-linux-amd64
chmod +x twill
./twill --version
```

That prints `Twill 1.7.1`. Swap the suffix for the machine: `linux-amd64`,
`linux-arm64`, `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64` or `windows-amd64.exe`.

Then the suites, from the root of a clone:

```bash
twill test tests
```

```
ok    tests/augment_test.tw
ok    tests/cache_test.tw
ok    tests/datasets_test.tw
ok    tests/pipeline_test.tw
ok    tests/stream_test.tw

5 file(s): 5 passed, 0 failed
```

### The example wants MNIST, and will fetch it only if you ask

`examples/train.tw` reads the real MNIST files. warp can now download them —
`ds.fetch` drives curl through twill's `run`, which arrived after 1.7.1 — but
nothing calls it for you: a library that quietly pulls a hundred and seventy
megabytes is a library that surprises people. The gunzip is still your step;
`docs/needs.md` entry 9 says why that one has not been taken.

The files go under `examples/`, not under the root of the clone: a relative
path in a twill program resolves against the directory of the file being run,
and `examples/train.tw` asks for `data/mnist`.

```bash
twill run tools/fetch.tw mnist examples/data/mnist
gunzip -k examples/data/mnist/*.gz
twill run examples/train.tw
```

or, with no warp involved at all, which is what it does for you:

```bash
mkdir -p examples/data/mnist
for f in train-images-idx3-ubyte train-labels-idx1-ubyte \
         t10k-images-idx3-ubyte t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte; do
  curl -fsSL -o "examples/data/mnist/$f.gz" \
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/cvdf-datasets/mnist/$f.gz"
done
```

That stops, on purpose, at the first thing warp checks:

```
warp: train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz has no pinned digest in warp. Its sha256 is 440fcabf73cc546fa21475e81ea370265605f56be210a4024d2ca8f203523609. Record it in src/datasets.tw and in docs/datasets.md before training on it.
```

Exit status 1. That is the refusal described under **Datasets** below, not a
bug: no digest in this repository is pinned yet, and warp will not read a
dataset whose bytes it cannot check. Expect to wait for it. sha256 is written
in twill, in `std/hash`, and the 9.9 MB training file took about four minutes
on the machine that produced the line above.

## Status

Every row that claims something works names the test that says so. A row that
says warp is not wired up means twill delivered the feature and warp has not
been changed to use it, which is not the same as being blocked.

| Piece | State |
| --- | --- |
| Composable pipeline: map, filter, batch, shuffle, repeat | works, `tests/pipeline_test.tw` |
| Prefetch | **declared only.** `pipe.prefetch` records a depth and `validate` checks where it sits, but `iterate` does nothing with it: there is no second thread to overlap against. The depth is a statement of intent, which is why the cache key ignores it |
| A declared dtype carried to the batch, so the model builds it narrow not at f64 | the declaration works and survives the cache, `tests/cache_test.tw`. The bytes are still f64. twill's NEEDS-111 is marked done in the self-hosted tree, where `src/buf.tw` packs the layout, but the Go bootstrap everyone actually runs still holds a tensor as `[]float64` with no dtype, so there is no saving to measure yet |
| The order check that catches shuffle-after-batch | works, `tests/pipeline_test.tw` |
| Disk cache keyed on the transformation chain | works. twill 1.7 has the file IO this was written against. `tests/cache_test.tw` covers the key, `explain` and the encoding, and `write`, `read`, `has` and `prune` against real files |
| Augmentation for images and sequences, each seeded explicitly | works, `tests/augment_test.tw` |
| Deterministic per-sample seeding | works, `rng.seed_for` and `rng.permutation` in `tests/augment_test.tw` |
| Streaming for data larger than memory | works. `read_file_at` was the whole of this entry and twill 1.7 has it; `tests/stream_test.tw` reads a real file larger than one chunk |
| Dataset descriptions with origin, licence and checksums | works, `tests/datasets_test.tw`; **the digests are not yet pinned**, see below |
| Downloading a dataset | **not written.** twill has neither a network nor a process builtin, see docs/needs.md |
| Number parsing | warp ships its own in `src/strutil.tw`. twill 1.7 has no `parse_i64` or `parse_f64`, so it stays |
| Tests | 5 suites, run by `twill test tests`, which CI runs against a pinned release on every push |
| Bundled datasets | **never.** warp describes data, it does not ship it |
| Parallel loading across processes | **not planned for v0.1** |
| Anything running end to end | the suites do. `examples/train.tw` runs as far as the digest refusal and stops there by design |

## The worked example

```rust
mode systems

import "twill_modules/warp/src/pipeline.tw" as pipe
import "twill_modules/warp/src/augment.tw" as aug
import "twill_modules/warp/src/rng.tw" as rng
import "twill_modules/warp/src/cache.tw" as cache
import "twill_modules/warp/src/dtype.tw" as dt
import "twill_modules/warp/src/sample.tw" as smp

let RUN_SEED: I64 = 20260807

fn build(src: pipe.Source, epoch: I64) -> pipe.Pipeline {
  let p = pipe.from_source(src)

  # Every stage carries a name and a version. They are not documentation: they
  # are the stage's identity in the cache key, because a function value cannot
  # be hashed. Change what the function does, change the version.
  p = pipe.map(p, "standardise", 1, fn(s: smp.Sample) -> smp.Sample = standardise(s))
  p = pipe.map(p, "crop-32-pad-4", 1,
    fn(s: smp.Sample) -> smp.Sample = aug.random_crop(s, 32, 32, 4, rng.seed_for(RUN_SEED, epoch, s.id)))

  # Scaled pixels are meant for f32, so declare it: the batch carries the dtype
  # and the model builds its tensor narrow in one step rather than at f64 and a
  # cast after, which moves twice the bytes for nothing. A declaration today, a
  # real narrow store once twill NEEDS-111 lands; either way the cache keys on
  # it, so f32 and bf16 runs never share an entry.
  p = pipe.astype(p, dt.DT_F32)

  # Shuffle, then batch. The other order gives every batch the same 32 samples
  # for the whole run. See the top of src/pipeline.tw.
  p = pipe.shuffle(p, 10000, RUN_SEED)
  p = pipe.batch(p, 128, false)
  p = pipe.prefetch(p, 2)
  p
}

fn main() {
  let p = build(cifar_source(), 0)

  # Says nothing when the order is sensible, and names both stages when it is
  # not. A warning rather than an error: there are real reasons to batch first.
  let warnings = pipe.validate(p)
  let w: I64 = 0
  while w < len(warnings) {
    write_err("warp: " + warnings[w] + "\n")
    w = w + 1
  }

  let it = pipe.iterate(p)
  while true {
    match pipe.next_batch(it) {
      Opt.None => return,
      Opt.Some(b) => train_step(b),
    }
  }
}
```

## The three things worth reading

### The order stages compose in

Stages apply in the order they were added, and the two orders people mix up
produce different training runs without either one failing.

- **shuffle then batch**: each batch is a fresh mix, and the composition of
  every batch changes each epoch.
- **batch then shuffle**: samples are grouped in file order and then the groups
  are reordered. The same samples travel together for the whole run.

If the data is sorted by class, which is the usual layout on disk, the second
gives batches that are each a single class. Batch normalisation then computes
its statistics over one class at a time, the gradient is systematically wrong,
and the run does not crash. It converges to something worse, and the loss curve
looks plausible.

warp does not reorder the stages behind your back, because then the code says
one thing and does another. `pipe.validate` reports the suspicious order,
naming both stages, and the caller decides. The full argument is at the top of
[`src/pipeline.tw`](src/pipeline.tw), including the two other orderings that
matter: map before filter, and repeat before shuffle.

### The cache key

The cache is keyed on the **whole transformation chain**, not on the output and
not on the source:

```
key = sha256(cache format version
             + source name, version and size
             + every stage that can change a sample's value, in order)
```

Five decisions are packed into that, and each is argued in the header of
[`src/cache.tw`](src/cache.tw). The two with consequences:

**A stage that changes behaviour must change its name or raise its version.**
There is no way for a program to hash the behaviour of a function value it was
handed. Two different functions are indistinguishable to anything except running
them on every input. So the obligation is on the caller, and warp makes it
unavoidable by requiring a name and a version on every `map` and `filter` rather
than defaulting them. A library that let you write `.map(f)` would be silently
wrong the first time anyone edited `f`, and it would look like it worked.
`cache.is_fresh` is the safety net: an entry older than the source files that
define the pipeline is treated as a miss even when the key matches.

**Batching, prefetching and repeating are excluded from the key.** None of them
changes what a sample contains, so changing the batch size does not throw away
an hour of decoding. Shuffle is included, with its seed, because a cached
artefact is a sequence and its order is part of it.

`cache.explain` returns the exact text that was hashed, so "why did my cache
miss" is answered with a diff rather than a hex string.

### Seeding

Every augmentation takes a seed, not a generator:

```rust
aug.random_crop(s, 32, 32, 4, rng.seed_for(RUN_SEED, epoch, s.id))
```

`seed_for` mixes the run seed, the epoch and the sample's own index, so sample
4,013 of epoch 2 gets the same crop on every machine, in any order, with any
number of workers. Mixing rather than adding matters: added, epoch 1 sample 2
and epoch 2 sample 1 are the same seed, and the resulting correlation across an
epoch is invisible in a loss curve.

## Datasets

warp bundles no data. Each dataset is a description: origin, citation, licence,
files, expected sizes and digests, plus the code to read the format once the
file is on disk.

| Dataset | Origin | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MNIST | LeCun and Cortes, 1998 | CC BY-SA 3.0 |
| Fashion-MNIST | Zalando Research, 2017 | MIT |
| CIFAR-10 | Krizhevsky, University of Toronto, 2009 | not stated by the authors; cite the technical report |
| Iris | Fisher, 1936, via UCI | CC BY 4.0 as distributed by UCI |

**The digests are not pinned yet, and warp refuses to use a dataset whose digest
it has not pinned.** A hash copied from somewhere without checking it against the
real file is worse than no hash, because it looks like verification and is not.
`verify` prints the digest it computed so it can be recorded. The open item is
in [`docs/datasets.md`](docs/datasets.md).

Refusing rather than warning is the same bias twill takes everywhere else: when
the signal is ambiguous, assume less. A warning in a training log is not read.

## Streaming

`src/stream.tw` is for data that does not fit in memory, and it is a different
shape from the indexable pipeline rather than a mode of it. What is given up is
stated in the file: no length, no random access and therefore no true shuffle
(the reservoir in `pipeline.tw` is the approximation), and one pass unless the
file can be reopened unchanged. A reopen of a file that changed size or mtime
during the run is refused, because half a run trained on one file and half on
another is a result nobody can interpret.

## The sibling repositories

- [twill](https://github.com/twill-lang/twill), the language.
- [spool](https://github.com/twill-lang/spool), the package manager. warp used
  to take `src/sha256.tw` from it; it now uses `std/hash` from twill itself, so
  there is still exactly one digest in the toolchain and warp no longer needs a
  vendored checkout to compute a cache key.
- [weft](https://github.com/twill-lang/weft), plotting. Nothing here imports
  it. The split is that warp loads data and weft draws it, and a pipeline that
  also plotted would be two libraries in one.
